Project Description: Binary Trees in C

Project Overview:

This project focuses on understanding and implementing various aspects of binary trees in the C programming language. Led by Alexandre Gautier, the project involves teams of two individuals, with your team consisting of Nader Babo Albaire. The project spans from Feb 26, 2024, 6:00 AM, to Mar 1, 2024, 6:00 AM, with a checker released on Feb 27, 2024, 6:00 AM. An auto-review will be launched at the deadline to evaluate the project.

Resources and Learning Objectives:

Participants are expected to delve into resources covering binary trees, tree data structures, tree traversal, and related topics. By the end of the project, participants should be proficient in explaining the following concepts without relying on external sources:

    Understanding binary trees and their distinction from Binary Search Trees.
    Analyzing the potential time complexity gains compared to linked lists.
    Explaining the concepts of depth, height, and size in binary trees.
    Familiarity with different traversal methods for binary trees.
    Understanding various types of binary trees such as complete, full, perfect, and balanced.

Copyright and Plagiarism:

The project emphasizes originality and prohibits plagiarism. Participants are required to develop solutions independently to meet the learning objectives. Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

Requirements:

General requirements include using specific editors (vi, vim, emacs), compiling files on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with specified options, adhering to the Betty style, avoiding global variables, limiting functions per file, and including prototypes in a header file called binary_trees.h. Additionally, participants are expected to utilize the provided data structures and types for binary trees and adhere to GitHub repository guidelines.

Conclusion:

This project offers a comprehensive opportunity for participants to deepen their understanding of binary trees, enhance their C programming skills, and develop original solutions to meet specified requirements. Through collaboration and adherence to project guidelines, participants will demonstrate proficiency in implementing and explaining fundamental concepts related to binary trees in the C programming language.# binary_trees
